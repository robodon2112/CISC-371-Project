        <p> This will be the page for Support staff to log into to acces and open tickets if they are experincing any sort of 
            difficulty. There will be a "create ticket" button that will allow them to write what issues they are ecperiencing 
            and will be sent with their user data to the MySql database I set up with a primary key (ticket #) that will be auto
            generated by MySql. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These tickets will be shared accorss the other users (helpdesk, admin, manager,) and each users own open and closed 
            tickets will be available on their own log in screens. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We as a group can dicuss the nuances and features we would like to add to make the app function.
